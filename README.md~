In this guessing game, the browser prompts the user with the question "What is my favorite browser?" Then, depending upon their answer, the game will output a response. There are five possible outcomes. There are three pre-defined wrong answers, which each output a seperate response, and another wrong answer response that happens if the wrong answer is not one of the pre-defined ones, and of course, there's the right answer response.
